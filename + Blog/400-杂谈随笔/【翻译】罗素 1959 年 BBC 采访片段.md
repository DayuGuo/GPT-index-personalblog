Q: One last question: Suppose to that, Lord Russell, this film would be looked at by our descendants, like a dead-sea scroll in a thousand of years time... What would you think it is worth telling that generation about the life you've lived in and the lessons you've learned from it?

主持人：这是最后一个问题了，罗素先生。假设这段录像，如死海古卷一般，千年后重现，被那个时代的人们所看到，您有什么想对他们说的吗？

Russell: I should like to say two things, one intellectual, and one moral.

罗素：我想要说两点，关于智慧和道德。

The intellectual thing I should want to say to them is this: When you are studying any matter, or considering any philosophy, ask yourself only what are the facts and what is the truth that the facts bear out?

关于智慧，我想说的是：无论你在研究什么事物，或是思考任何观点，请扪心自问，事实是什么？事实所引出真理是什么？

Never let yourself be diverted either by what you wish to believe or by what you think could have been beneficent social effects if it were believed.

不要被那些「自己希望相信的观点」和「自认为对社会更有益的东西」所影响。

But look only, and solely , at what are the facts, That is the intellectual thing that I shoud wish to say.

而是单纯的审视，什么是事实。

The Moral thing I shoud wish to say to them is very simple, I shoud say, love is wise, hatred is foolish.

关于道德，我想说的非常简单。
爱是明智的，恨是愚蠢的。

In the world which is getting more and more closely interconnected... we have to learn to tolerate each other, we have to learn to put up with the fact that some people say things that we don't like.

现在，人与人之间的边界正被逐渐消解，我们必须学会容忍彼此，我们必须接受这样一个事实：世界上有太多不同的观点，其中很多是我们不喜欢的。

We can only live together in that way , and if we are to live together and not die together, we must learn a kind of charity and a kind of tolerance, which is absolutely vital to eh continuation of human life on this planet.

只有这样，我们才有共存的可能，而非灭亡。
仁慈和容忍是我们必须具备的特质，这对人类能否在这个星球上生存至关重要。

>“Three passions, simple but overwhelmingly strong, have governed my life: the longing for love, the search for knowledge, and unbearable pity for the suffering of mankind.”

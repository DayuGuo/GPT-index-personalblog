>Indeed, wisdom is rooted in this willingness – this responsibility – to entertain ideas brought to you by others. To listen carefully. To think critically. To challenge your views – and then to change them when the discovery of truth demands it.

智慧植根于**倾听**的意愿，在于接受他人的观点的勇气。
要仔细的听，批判性的思考，挑战固有的观点，并在发现真相时**改变**它们。

>Today, I wish to focus on the courage to acknowledge all we do not know, to admit when we are wrong, and to change our minds.

承认自身**无知**的勇气，承认自身**错误**的勇气，改变自己**想法**的勇气，是当下我们需要重视的。

>As Justice Sonya Sotomayor said recently, “It is, I fear, too easy for people to fail to listen when what they’re hearing is different than what they think.”

索尼娅·索托马约尔法官曾说：「另人警醒的是，当听到不同的观点，装作听不见是最简单的，也是大多数人的选择。」

>As we know, engaging with those who hold profoundly different perspectives threatens not to betray our beliefs, but to broaden them. **Listening to that with which we may disagree is an act not of conciliation, but of fidelity to truth. And admitting what we got wrong is no sign of failure, but a necessary step toward knowledge.**

与意见向左之人的交流，并不意味着背弃信念，而是扩大彼此的意识边界。
倾听那些不同的意见，并不是一种和解，而是**对真理的追寻**。
**承认错误**，并非失败，而是探索知识的必要一步。
